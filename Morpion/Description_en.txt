        This project is an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game
        using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete on a 3x3 grid,
        tracking scores and indicating the current player.

    Code Overview

            Game Grid: A 3x3 grid created using nested <div> elements with classes row and cell. Each cell represents a square on the game board.

            Win Display: A <span> element with the class win-display to show the winning player (<span class="win-display">Joueur ?? a gagn√© !</span>).

            Controls: Includes player score displays and a "Replay" button.

                Scores: Two <div> elements displaying "Joueur 1" and "Joueur 2" with their respective scores (<span id="playerOne">0</span> and <span id="playerTwo">0</span>).

                Replay Button: A <button> element with the ID replay to reset the game.
