    Project Description

        This PHP script is a simple implementation of the classic Battleship game for two players.
        Each player positions their ships on a 5x5 grid and takes turns attempting to sink the opponent's ships
        by guessing their coordinates. The game continues until one player has no remaining ships.

    Functionality

        Grid Initialization

            The game initializes two 5x5 grids using the initGrid($x, $y) function, creating empty grids for each player.
        
        Ship Placement

            Players are prompted to place two ships on their grid by entering X and Y coordinates.
        
            The addShip(&$grid, $x, $y, $posX, $posY) function adds ships to the grid if the coordinates are valid and the position is unoccupied.
        
        Gameplay Loop

            Players take turns attacking each other's grid.
        
            During a turn, a player inputs the X and Y coordinates for their attack.
        
            The attack(&$grid, $posX, $posY) function checks if a ship is at the specified location:
        
            If a ship is hit, it's marked with an "O" and the player is informed.
        
            If the attack misses, the player is notified.
        
        Win Condition

            After each attack, the hasShips($grid) function checks if the opponent has any remaining ships.
        
            The game ends when a player has sunk all of the opponent's ships.
        
        Grid Display

            The displayGrid($grid, $x, $y) function visually displays the grids, showing hits and misses.
