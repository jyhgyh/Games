    Project Description

        This PHP project provides a function that creates and displays a grid representing a game board with ships
        
        placed at specified coordinates. The grid's dimensions are determined by the parameters
        
        $x (number of columns) and $y (number of rows). Ships are marked with an "X"
        
        on the grid based on the coordinates provided in the $ships array.

    Function Overview

        The function colle($x, $y, array $ships = []) performs the following steps:
        
        Input Validation: Checks if $x and $y are greater than zero. If not, the function returns without executing further.
        
        Grid Initialization: Creates a two-dimensional array $grid filled with spaces (" "), representing an empty game board.
        
        Ship Placement: Iterates over the $ships array and places an "X" on the grid at each valid coordinate. Coordinates outside the grid boundaries are ignored.
        
        Grid Display: Outputs the grid with borders using ASCII characters, showing the placement of ships.

    Usage Example

        colle(5, 3, [[0, 1], [2, 1], [1, 2], [1, 7]]);

        This example creates a grid with 5 columns and 3 rows, placing ships at the coordinates (2,1), (2,1), (1,2), and (1,7).

        Note that the coordinate (1,7) is outside the grid bounds and will be ignored.
